<h1>Darrel's Favorite Alfred Hitchcock Films</h1>
<h2>My top 3 film picks.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rear Window</h3>
<p>The first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It is still one of my favorites
    and I watch it at least once a year. While not scary, you do wondering what will happen next
    and will love and justice prevail. I think <b>James Stewart</b> and <b>Grace Kelly</b> give 
    their best on-screen performances.

<h3>To Catch A Thief</h3>
<p>A great thriller and who-dun-it. Did <i>John "The Cat" Robie,</i> played by <b>Cary Grant</b>, return to
    a life of crime? Can <i>Frances Stevens,</i> played by <b>Grace Kelly,</b> fall in love with
    such a man? Watch the movie to find out.

</i></p>
<h3>The Birds</h3>
<p>I believe this is the scariest Hitchcock movie. Different breeds of birds
    start attacking people. Why? Only the birds know and they aren't saying.
    Staring <b>Rod Taylor</b> and <b>Tippy Hedren.</b> Does <i>Melanie,</i> <b>Tippy's</b> character,
    play a part in the birds wrath or is she just in the wrong place at the
    wrong time.
    After watching this movie you'll want to put a padlock on Polly's cage
    and keep a fire going in the fireplace year round.
